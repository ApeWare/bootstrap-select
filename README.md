Bootstrap-select is a jQuery plugin that utilizes Bootstrap's dropdown.js to style and bring additional functionality to standard select elements.

## Demo and Documentation

You can view a live demo and some examples of how to use the various options [here](http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select).

Bootstrap-select's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with MkDocs and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select. The documentation may also be run locally.


### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, [install MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation).
3. From the `/bootstrap-select/docs` directory, run `mkdocs serve` in the command line.
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser, and voil√†.

Learn more about using MkDocs by reading its [documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/).

## Usage

Create your `<select>` with the `.selectpicker` class.
```html
<select class="selectpicker">
  <option>Mustard</option>
  <option>Ketchup</option>
  <option>Barbecue</option>
</select>
```

If you use a 1.6.3 or newer, you don't need to do anything else, as the data-api automatically picks up the `<select>`s with the `selectpicker` class.

If you use an older version, you need to add the following either at the bottom of the page (after the last selectpicker), or in a [`$(document).ready()`](http://api.jquery.com/ready/) block.
```js
// To style only <select>s with the selectpicker class
$('.selectpicker').selectpicker();
```
Or
```js
// To style all <select>s
$('select').selectpicker();
```

## This Fork contains the following features

I have made some backward compatible modifications to bootstrap-select for a project I am working on and wanted to know if there would be any interest in adding them to the project before sending a pull request.

**My code does the following:**
- allows disabling of the browser tooltip on the bootstrap-select button while still using `title` attribute for select label
- allows display of label along with the selected data. Label changes to `strong`, or can optionally pass a class name for alternate styling, while displaying selected items after label.

In order to keep things backwards compatible I added some additional data attribute options (e.g. `data-label-with-values="true"`):

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| labelWithValues | boolean | `false` | When set to `true`, the title field is placed statically in the dropdown. Once an item is selected from dropdown, it is appended to the title (see below demo). |
| labelClass | string |  | Requires `labelWithValues` attribute. optional class to style label when item(s) are selected. Label is wrapped in a `strong` tag when items are selected. |
| hideTooltip | boolean | `false` | When set to `true`, the `title` is not set on the generated button, preventing the browser's tooltip from generating |

**This image better describes the functionality:**

These attributes are completely optional and do not negatively impact current functionality.
